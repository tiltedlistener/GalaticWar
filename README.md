# GALACTIC WAR

Based off of the book ("Java SE 6 Game Programming" by Jonathan S. Harbour.)[http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Java-SE-Game-Programming/dp/1435458087/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1402466832&sr=8-1&keywords=java+se+6+game]

This version uses JFrame instead of the Applet class because I'm tired of Applets.
